# Fork of Classic Raid Tracker

> Keeps account of attendance and loot for raids. Adaption of https://legacy-wow.com/mop-addons/mizus-raid-tracker/ to work with World of Warcraft Classic. For retail please use the original project.

# thatsmybis.com
this version was updated to replace the original HTML export with a https://www.thatsmybis.com compatible version. Small dirty hacks that are not properly tested have been added to start logging automatically once an instance is entered.
